# 🎯 GROUPS FUNCTIONALITY - COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## 📋 Overview
This guide will help you deploy the new Groups functionality in your Tangle app. The feature allows users to create groups with people from their society, join existing groups, and manage group memberships.

## 🚀 What's New
- **4-Step Group Creation Flow**: Topic selection → Details → Members → Review
- **Society-Bound Groups**: Groups are isolated by society (no cross-society visibility)
- **Member Management**: Add/remove members, role-based permissions
- **Topic Categorization**: Sports, Music, Dance, Work, Travel, Other
- **Real-time Updates**: Live member counts and group status

## 🗄️ Backend Setup

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `GROUPS_BACKEND_SETUP.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the script

### Step 2: Verify Setup
After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ 3 new tables created: `groups`, `group_members`, `group_invitations`
- ✅ RLS policies enabled for security
- ✅ Sample groups created for Greater Kailash society
- ✅ Proper permissions granted to authenticated users

### Step 3: Check Database Structure
Run these verification queries:
```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'group%';

-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'group%';

-- Check sample data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM groups;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM group_members;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "relation 'groups' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the `GROUPS_BACKEND_SETUP.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor

#### 2. Permission Denied Errors
**Solution**: Ensure the script granted permissions correctly:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON public.groups TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON public.group_members TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON public.group_invitations TO authenticated;
```

#### 3. RLS Policy Errors
**Solution**: Check if RLS is enabled and policies exist:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename LIKE 'group%';
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'groups';
```

#### 4. Sample Data Not Visible
**Solution**: Verify society ID references:
```sql
SELECT * FROM societies WHERE name = 'Greater Kailash';
SELECT * FROM groups WHERE society_id = '[society_id]';
```
