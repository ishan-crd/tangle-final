# üéØ Interest Circles Feature - Deployment Guide

## Overview
The Interest Circles feature allows users to discover and connect with people in their society who share similar interests. This feature is **100% society-bound** - users can only see and interact with people from their own society.

## üîí Society Isolation Guarantee
- **Complete Data Isolation**: Users from one society cannot see users from other societies
- **Interest Matching**: Only shows people with common interests within the same society
- **Friend Requests**: Can only send friend requests to people in the same society
- **Database Level Security**: Enforced through RLS policies and society filtering

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Friendships Table Script
Execute the `CREATE_FRIENDSHIPS_TABLE.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor. This script will:

1. **Create the friendships table** for managing friend relationships
2. **Add new columns** to user_profiles (interests, bio, occupation)
3. **Create database functions** for efficient interest matching
4. **Set up RLS policies** for security
5. **Add sample data** for testing

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
After running the script, verify these tables exist:
- `friendships` - Manages friend relationships
- `user_profiles` - Updated with new columns

### Step 3: Check RLS Policies
Ensure RLS is enabled on the `friendships` table with these policies:
- Users can view their own friendships
- Users can create friendship requests (same society only)
- Users can update/delete their own friendship requests

## üé® Feature Components

### 1. Hub Page Integration
- **Interest Circles Card**: Now clickable (no more lock overlay)
- **Navigation**: Routes to `/main/interest-circles`
- **Visual Design**: Green-themed card with people emoji

### 2. Interest Circles Page
- **Header**: Back navigation and title
- **Stats**: Shows match count and user's interest count
- **Interest Filters**: Filter matches by specific interests
- **Match Cards**: Display potential friends with match scores
- **Add Friend**: Send friend requests to matches

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Functions
```sql
-- Get users with common interests (optimized)
get_users_with_common_interests(current_user_id, current_user_society)

-- Check friendship status
are_users_friends(user1_id, user2_id)

-- View friendship status
friendship_status
```

### Interest Matching Algorithm
1. **Society Filter**: Only users from the same society
2. **Interest Overlap**: Calculate common interests
3. **Match Score**: Percentage of interests that match
4. **Sorting**: Highest match scores first
5. **Filtering**: By specific interest categories

### Friend Request System
1. **Check Existing**: Prevent duplicate requests
2. **Society Validation**: Ensure both users are in same society
3. **Status Management**: Track pending/accepted/rejected requests
4. **Real-time Updates**: Refresh list after actions

## üì± User Experience Flow

### 1. Discovery
- User navigates to Interest Circles from Hub
- System loads users with common interests
- Displays match cards with scores and details

### 2. Filtering
- User can filter by specific interests
- "All Interests" shows everyone with any common interest
- Individual interest filters show specific matches

### 3. Connection
- User views potential friend's profile
- Sees common interests, bio, occupation
- Clicks "Add Friend" to send request

### 4. Friend Management
- Friend requests are stored in `friendships` table
- Status tracking (pending, accepted, rejected)
- Prevents duplicate requests

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i CREATE_FRIENDSHIPS_TABLE.sql
```

### 2. Verify Setup
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('friendships');

-- Check if columns were added
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('interests', 'bio', 'occupation');

-- Test the function
SELECT * FROM get_users_with_common_interests(
  'your-user-id', 'your-society-name'
);
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. **Login as different users** from the same society
2. **Navigate to Interest Circles** from Hub
3. **Verify society isolation** - no cross-society data
4. **Test interest filtering** - different interest categories
5. **Test friend requests** - send and verify storage

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Society Isolation Test
```sql
-- User A (Ajnara Society) should only see Ajnara users
-- User B (Plak Rounds Society) should only see Plak Rounds users
-- No cross-society data should be visible
```

### Interest Matching Test
```sql
-- Users with more common interests should have higher match scores
-- Filtering by specific interests should work correctly
-- Empty results for interests no one shares
```

### Friend Request Test
```sql
-- Friend requests should be stored in friendships table
-- Duplicate requests should be prevented
-- RLS policies should enforce society boundaries
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Function not available" Error**
   - The database function wasn't created
   - Solution: Re-run the SQL script

2. **No Interest Matches Found**
   - Users don't have interests set
   - Solution: Update user_profiles with sample interests

3. **Cross-Society Data Visible**
   - RLS policies not working
   - Solution: Verify RLS is enabled and policies exist

4. **Friend Requests Not Working**
   - Friendships table not created
   - Solution: Check table creation and RLS policies

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check user interests
SELECT id, name, society, interests FROM user_profiles LIMIT 5;

-- Check friendships table
SELECT * FROM friendships LIMIT 5;

-- Test interest matching function
SELECT * FROM get_users_with_common_interests(
  (SELECT id FROM user_profiles LIMIT 1),
  'Ajnara'
);
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Indexes
- `idx_friendships_user_id` - Fast friend lookups
- `idx_user_profiles_interests` - GIN index for array searches
- `idx_user_profiles_society` - Society-based filtering

### Query Optimization
- Database function for complex interest matching
- Fallback to manual queries if function unavailable
- Efficient array operations for interest comparison

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Friendships**: Users can only see their own relationships
- **User Profiles**: Society-based access control
- **Interest Data**: Protected by user authentication

### Society Boundaries
- **Database Level**: All queries filter by society
- **Application Level**: User context validation
- **API Level**: Supabase RLS enforcement

## üéØ Production Checklist

- [ ] Society isolation verified
- [ ] Interest matching working correctly
- [ ] Friend requests functional
- [ ] Performance tested with sample data
- [ ] Error handling implemented

## üöÄ Going Live

1. **Deploy database changes** during low-traffic period
2. **Test with real users** from different societies
3. **Monitor performance** and RLS policy execution
4. **Verify society isolation** is working correctly
5. **Check friend request functionality**
6. **Monitor for any errors** in the console

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify all SQL scripts executed successfully
3. Test database functions manually
4. Check RLS policies are active
5. Verify user profiles have society and interest data

The Interest Circles feature is designed to be completely secure and society-isolated while providing a great user experience for discovering like-minded neighbors!
